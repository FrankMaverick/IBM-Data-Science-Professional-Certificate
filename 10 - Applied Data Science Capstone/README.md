# Project Overview

In this capstone project, we aim to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage, a crucial factor in determining the cost of a rocket launch by SpaceX. The ability to reuse the first stage significantly reduces launch expenses, making SpaceX's Falcon 9 more cost-effective compared to other providers. The project's primary goal is to assist a new rocket company, Space Y, in competing with SpaceX by predicting launch prices and assessing the likelihood of first stage reuse.

## Learning Objectives

1. Develop Python code for data manipulation in a Pandas data frame.
2. Convert a JSON file into a Pandas data frame for analysis.
3. Create a sharable Jupyter notebook using GitHub.
4. Apply data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem.
5. Utilize data analysis tools to load, clean, and extract insights from datasets.

## Commercial Space Industry Context

- **Space Exploration Landscape:**
Overview of companies making space travel affordable, including Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, and SpaceX.

- **SpaceX Achievements:**
SpaceX's notable accomplishments, such as sending spacecraft to the International Space Station, Starlink satellite constellation, and manned space missions.

- **Cost Efficiency Through Reusability:**
Explanation of SpaceX's cost advantage due to reusing the Falcon 9 first stage, reducing launch costs to $62 million compared to competitors' $165 million.

## Project Tasks

- **Role and Goal:**
  - Participants assume the role of a data scientist working for Space Y, aiming to compete with SpaceX.
  - Objective: Determine launch prices and predict the reuse likelihood of SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage.

- **Methodology Shift:**
  - Rather than relying on traditional rocket science, the project employs machine learning to predict the success of the first stage landing based on publicly available information.

## Additional Resources
