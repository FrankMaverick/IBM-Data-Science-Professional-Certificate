# Predictive Analysis Module Overview

In this module, we will implement a machine learning pipeline to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9's first stage. The process involves preprocessing the data, standardizing it, and splitting it into training and testing sets. The primary machine learning models considered for prediction are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree Classifier, and K-nearest neighbors. Grid Search will be performed to find the optimal hyperparameters for each model, and the best-performing model will be determined using the test data.

## Learning Objectives

- **Data Splitting:** Split the dataset into training and testing data to evaluate model performance.

- **Model Training:** Train different classification models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree Classifier, and K-nearest neighbors.

- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Utilize Grid Search to find the optimal hyperparameters for each classification model.

- **Model Comparison:** Evaluate and compare the performance of Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier, and K-nearest neighbors using test data.

- **Business Application:** Utilize machine learning skills to build a predictive model, contributing to more efficient business functions.

## Machine Learning Pipeline Steps

1. **Preprocessing:** Standardize the data for consistent model input.

2. **Train-Test Split:** Split the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Training:** Train different classification models on the training data.

4. **Grid Search:** Perform Grid Search to find the optimal hyperparameters for each model.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance on the test data.

6. **Comparison and Selection:** Compare the performance of Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier, and K-nearest neighbors.

7. **Confusion Matrix:** Output the confusion matrix to assess the model's ability to predict successful first stage landings.

## Business Impact

The predictive model built in this lab aims to contribute to more efficient decision-making processes, helping businesses determine the likelihood of successful Falcon 9 first stage landings using machine learning techniques.
